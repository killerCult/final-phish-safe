	Please feel free to report a definite phishing website. The previous active URL's link has been 
	automatically inserted in the form. If you want to report some other URL, please change the URL 
	in the form.
		<br><br>
	We define a phishing URL as one that is attempting to impersonate a site operated by an organisation 
	with which the victim of the phishing attempt has an existing relationship, in order to obtain passwords 
	or other personal information for use in some type of fraud.
		<br><br>
	This does not include sites such as fake banks, fake escrow sites, fake online shops, fake courier companies 
	and so on, unless those sites are attempting to impersonate a site operated by a specific real organisation. 
	Even if such sites are attempting to gather personal information or credit card details, 
	we do not count them as phishing sites unless a specific real organisation is being impersonated.
